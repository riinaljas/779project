```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

```

## R Markdown


```{r load everything}
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
mydata <- readRDS("sampledata.RDS") %>% head(100) %>% select(1:105) 

source("functions.R")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

datatable(mydata)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
